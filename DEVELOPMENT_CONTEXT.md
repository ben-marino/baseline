### **üü° MOBILE DEVELOPMENT ALIGNMENT - API GATEWAY STRATEGY**

#### **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Foundation Architecture**
- [x] **Unified API Service**: Single service handling all server communication through gateway
- [x] **Tenant Context Management**: Mobile app maintains current tenant and user role state
- [x] **JWT Token Management**: Automatic token refresh with tenant context
- [x] **Offline-First Sync**: Cache management respects tenant boundaries

---

## **üîÑ RISK MITIGATION - DAY 4 UPDATED**

### **üî¥ HIGH-RISK ITEMS - UPDATED**

#### **Professional Services Integration Complexity**
- **Risk**: Professional workflow integration more complex than estimated, could delay Day 4 completion
- **Probability**: Medium (40%) - Complex multi-tenant professional features with real-time collaboration
- **Impact**: Could delay Day 4 completion and cascade to deployment timeline
- **Updated Mitigation**: 
  - ‚úÖ Prioritize core counselor dashboard and client management (70% complete)
  - ‚úÖ Implement professional features in phases: dashboard ‚Üí session management ‚Üí real-time collaboration
  - üîÑ Use feature flags to isolate advanced professional features if WebSocket integration has issues
  - üîÑ Fallback to simplified professional session model (basic client list and session initiation without real-time collaboration)

#### **WebSocket Professional Session Reliability**
- **Risk**: Real-time collaboration may be unreliable under load or have integration issues with API Gateway
- **Probability**: Medium (35%) - WebSocket complexity with multi-tenant context and API Gateway routing
- **Impact**: Could compromise professional collaboration features and affect business demos
- **Updated Mitigation**:
  - ‚úÖ WebSocket reconnection logic implemented in mobile app
  - ‚úÖ Professional session state persistence for reconnection scenarios
  - üîÑ Graceful degradation to HTTP polling if WebSocket fails
  - üîÑ Connection monitoring and automatic recovery mechanisms
  - üîÑ Simplified collaboration mode without real-time features as fallback

### **üü° MEDIUM-RISK ITEMS - UPDATED**

#### **Mobile-Server Professional Contract Implementation Gap**
- **Risk**: Mobile UI expectations may not fully align with server API implementation details
- **Probability**: Low (20%) - Well-defined interfaces and continuous synchronization
- **Impact**: Could require mobile UI adjustments or server API modifications
- **Updated Mitigation**:
  - ‚úÖ Shared interface definitions finalized and agreed between teams
  - ‚úÖ Continuous integration testing of mobile-server professional contract
  - üîÑ Regular synchronization meetings (every 2 hours during Day 4)
  - üîÑ Mock data available for mobile development if live APIs have issues

#### **Database Performance with Professional Analytics**
- **Risk**: Materialized views and professional analytics queries may impact performance
- **Probability**: Low (25%) - Optimized indexing and caching strategy in place
- **Impact**: Could affect counselor dashboard load times and overall system performance
- **Updated Mitigation**:
  - ‚úÖ Database indexing strategy optimized for professional analytics queries
  - ‚úÖ Caching layer implemented for frequently accessed counselor data
  - üîÑ Performance monitoring active during professional features testing
  - üîÑ Query optimization and materialized view refresh strategy ready for adjustment
