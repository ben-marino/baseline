## **üìä Risk Assessment & Mitigation - Day 8**

### **üî¥ High-Risk Items**
1. **npm Dependency Installation Timeout**
   - **Risk**: Blocks production build execution
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple package manager alternatives prepared (yarn, pnpm)
   - **Contingency**: Docker-based build pipeline as backup approach
   - **Timeline Impact**: 30-60 minutes if resolved with alternatives

2. **Cloud Deployment Authentication Issues**
   - **Risk**: CI/CD pipeline may fail due to credential configuration
   - **Mitigation**: Pre-validated service account configuration and environment setup
   - **Contingency**: Manual deployment procedures documented as backup
   - **Timeline Impact**: Minimal if credentials are properly configured

### **üü° Medium-Risk Items**
1. **Performance Targets Under Real Load**
   - **Risk**: Production performance may differ from development/testing
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive load testing scripts prepared and validated
   - **Contingency**: Performance optimization strategies identified
   - **Timeline Impact**: May require additional optimization time

2. **Security Scanning False Positives**
   - **Risk**: OWASP scanning may identify false positive vulnerabilities
   - **Mitigation**: Security testing framework configured with baseline expectations
   - **Contingency**: Manual security review procedures documented
   - **Timeline Impact**: Minimal impact on overall timeline

### **üü¢ Low-Risk Items**
1. **Advanced Features Integration**
   - **Risk**: Advanced features may need minor adjustments in production
   - **Mitigation**: Features already tested and validated in development
   - **Contingency**: Feature flag system allows gradual rollout
   - **Timeline Impact**: No impact on core deployment timeline
